				<p>MP is an exploration and experiment on how we understand, or attempt to understand, things beyond our comprehension. </p>

				<p>The question is will we ever be able to understand things falls out of our mental model? Things with no signal, no logic, and no pattern. Are we even capable of imagining such entity, or will we forever be trapped in our own framework?</p>

					<p class="ins">It all started with a conversation with my mother. I was trying to correct her on generalization on something she had said. Then she asked me, "isn't everything you learn and know is from generalizing, just on different scales?"</p>

					<img class="sc" src="Images/sc.jpg">

					<p id="scDes"> Her question stuck with me. In a way, she is not wrong. No matter how controled a study or an experiment is, the result or conclusion we get is also a generalization. No matter how big is the testing set, we'll never be able to examine every single incident or entity on the subject we are testing. This has promopted me to question whether the way we explore, discover and learn things is also limiting us because of how our brain works. They way we process things, our logical structure and brain module could be hindering us to only think in one frame work. </p>

						<p class="res">I started my research by looking at some of the recent writings and critiques on our current scientif method of experiment, but soon moved on to a more philosophical angle to examine our relation with knowledge and how our mental model limit us to think and behave in certain way.</p>

						<p class="ra"> Rationalism: Rationality is the main source of knowledge and reality has an intrinsically logical structure.</p>

						<p class="em"> Empiricism: knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience.</p>

						<p>By looking at the two main divisions of episitomology, even the views are very far from each other on the surface level. The structure of each side's argument and the logic used to prove the soundness of each argument are still the same. I can't stop to ask myself: "Do we have the ability to understand things/beings beyond our way of thinking? If such being exists, how would be interact with it?"</p>

						<p class="tit">Goals & Concept</p>
						<div class="write">
							<p>Creating an interactive experience to be incomprehensible, yet not completely meaningless to illustrate the idea of â€œbeyond our thinking". The interactions and experience should have no patterns, no rules, and appear to be confusing and unavailing. The entity M P is named after <i>Modus Ponens</i>, the rule of inference in propositional logic. Which if applied correctly will guarantee a valid argument. However, M P, the entity, on the contrary created by the human mind is trying to defy the very logic pattern it lives in. </p>

							<p class="p1">Prototype type one focuses on the notion of "paternless". By rolling the handle the users will be recieving random object dipensed by M P.</p>
