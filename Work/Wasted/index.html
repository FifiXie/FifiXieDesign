				<p id="tit">Story Behind Wasted</p>
				<p >I haven’t really sat down and thought about what <i>Wasted</i> really means to me. It all started in hot Seattle summer evening. I was sitting on my floor with a third degree burn on my right foot and trying to pack everything before I had to move out. It had been two weeks since I’ve walked or gone outside because of my injury. I have been so worried that it will leave a scar and I will never bring myself to wear any cute heels again. I looked around and lied my eyes on an old pair of leopard print Air Force. I’ve had them for so long and haven’t wore them since High School. I still remember begging my mom to buy them for me and had to wait until my birthday to finally open them and wear them. However, as time passes by them became less exciting. Then the guilt rose, the picture of me begging and begging and begging, as if they were the only thing I cared and needed in the whole world.  Now they are just resting on the bottom of my shoe shelf.</p>
				<p>For no reason I started to take them apart, stich by stich, piece by piece. It was a moment of relieve, they are no longer my responsibilities. That I don’t have to pack them with me anymore. It had been years since I wore them, but I always kept them every time I move. They weren’t in the best condition, nor I was ever that careful with them after the first 5 months of having them. For some reason I just can’t bring myself to throw them away. Even now, they are practically “garbage” after being cut into pieces. It didn’t make me feel any better knowing I didn’t treasure them after I had spent so much time expressing my desire for them.</p>
				<p>“Mom pleeeeeeeese, I will do anything.”</p>
				<p>“I think my feet are bigger, I need new shoes Mom.”</p>
				<p>“Why can’t I have them?”</p>

				<p>But they are just shoes, right? They aren’t supposed to be immortal. I needed new ones. It was okay to buy more shoes.</p>
				<p>Right?</p>

				<p>I looked at pairs after pairs of shoes stacked on my shelf, and then the pieces I cut, scattered all over the wooden floor. It felt like I had just ended something, and I should’ve felt better, but I didn’t. There is something I have to do to keep it alive, so the guilt does devour me. </p>

				<p>I looked at the pieces over and over and started to play with them, put one on top of another, tying shoes laces here and there. That’s when the first garment was created. Then I couldn’t stop, I took pairs after pairs, cutting them and sewing them back into bras. It felt like a revenge to the old me buying endless numbers of shoes, and then abandon them to get new ones. I eventually stopped when I couldn’t find any pairs of shoes that I felt justified to “destroy”. I took on some donations from friends to continuing the project and perfect my crafts, but the spirit of Wasted stopped when I had no guilty purchases left.</p>

				<p>I created <i>Wasted</i> to combat the guilt of always desiring more, to continue the lives of those shoes that I once loved and wasted.</p>
