				<p class="intro" >The game Tartarus aims to create an immersive experience for users that mimic real life scenarios to reflect on how peopleâ€™s behaviors change based on the group dynamics and conflicts between their personal goals and group goals. The game will be divided in to three different stages, at the beginning stage, the game will only present one collective goal among the players. During the second stage, the game will present conflicts between players personal interests and the group interests as a whole. Lastly, the game will only focus on personal goals. The project hopes to observe and record different dynamics, interactions and outcome of the game as the stages of goals progresses. </p>
