					<p class="w">	What Are Those? </p>
					<p > i i c is born based on an ideal relationship. </p>
					<p > Through every interaction we slowly build relationships with others. Every interaction we have with others we approach differently, develop different dynamics, and create different energy. It results in different relationships we end up having. For all of them, whether itâ€™s good or bad, positive or negative, stimulating or calm, I realize for every relationship to function properly both party needs to have initiatives, be willing to share intimate insights,and have open communications.</p>
					<p> i i c was then created to help others and I to remember what we need to keep in mind when we ours lives cross paths: to always have initiatives, intimacy, and communication in the relationships we build.</p>
