			<p>Hi I'm Fifi! I am an <mark>Experience Designer</mark> and <mark>artist</mark> based in New York.  My work range from consumer products, fashion designs, to interactive art installations. Most of my work focus on <mark>social problems and humanity issues</mark>, investigating the relationship between individuals and the social constructs they are surrounded by. I work on transforming those experiences, sentiments and social phenomena into <mark>immersive experience and interactive pieces</mark>. I am also passionate about teaching and education. I started as a teaching assistant as Parsons School of Design and held workshop in Sichuan Fine Arts Institute. I have participated in developing new course at Parsons as well.</p>


			<p>I graduated from <mark>Parson School of Design</mark> with a MFA degree in Design and Technology(2020). I received my bachelor’s degrees (2017) from <mark>University of Washington</mark> in Philosophy and Industrial Design. </p>
			

			<p>I also love woodworking, documentaries, stand-up comedy, and accumulating weird facts I found on the internet.</p>
