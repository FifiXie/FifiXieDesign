			<p>Hi I'm Fifi! I am a creative technologist, artist, and designer based in New York. I am currently working on my MFA at Parson School of Design studying Design and Technology. I received my bachelor’s degrees (2017) from University of Washington in Philosophy and Industrial Design. </p>
			
			<p>My work interests lie at the intersection of human and machine interactions and behaviors, with a focus on ethics. I am currently exploring and researching on <b> collective interests and inter-group conflict, technoethics, and HCI </b> in my early graduate work. I will be graduating from my program in May 2020.</p>
